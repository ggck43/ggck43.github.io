title: Reading the SICP
comments: true

I have waited long enough. Finally, I came to realise, its time I should read the [SICP](http://mitpress.mit.edu/sicp/) (Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs), widely regarded as the best CS book ever written. It feels kind of embarrassing that I have not yet read the book while I have an undergrad education in CS. 

So, I collected a copy from the unviersity library. The online version is also free. I have my emacs setup with the MIT-scheme. Lets dive in. I am planning to do all the exercises and will also try to post them here. I do not know how far can I proceed with that plan. But hopefully, I can follow though with that.
