My current research involves predicting new bacteriocins using machine learning methods. Bacteriocins are peptide derived molecules that can be used for devising new antibiotics. In a post-antibiotic era they can play a crucial role in providing source material for new antibiotics. To predict them we try to use spatial information of their location through various types of other genes and then use deep learning methods with traditional machine learning algorithms.
