I am a first year PhD student at the Bioinformatics and Computational Biology [(BCB)](http://bcb.iastate.edu/) program in [Iowa State University](http://www.iastate.edu/). The "Md" in my first name implies "Muhammad" (Though everybody calls me Nafiz, which is also a part of my first name). Back at my home in Bangladesh, it was (I guess it is not anymore) a kind of weird custom to make it short into "Md". Many people abroad gets confused what that means, so, here is the clarification.

I am currently doing my first year rotations. My current rotation is with Professor [Jeffrey Trimarchi](http://www.gdcb.iastate.edu/faculty-and-research/faculty/jeffrey-m-trimarchi/). I have also done rotations with Professor [Guang Song](http://www.cs.iastate.edu/~gsong) and Professor [Dianne Cook](http://dicook.github.io/).

I completed my undergrad in Computer Science from [Islamic University of Technology(IUT)](http://www.iutoic-dhaka.edu/), Bangladesh with an [OIC](http://www.oic-oci.org/oicv2/home/?lan=en) scholarship. Then I worked one and a half years as a software engineer at [Samsung R&D Institute, Bangladesh](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SRBD).

I love travelling and the picture you are seeing in this post is on the hill tracks at [Bandarban](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bandarban_District), [Bangladesh](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bangladesh).
